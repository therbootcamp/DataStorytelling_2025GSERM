Dear participants of the Data Storytelling with R course!

We are looking forward to getting to know you and working with you on exciting data stories!

As preparation for the course we ask you to be on the lookout for an interesting dataset that answers a question that might be research/work related or just popup in your spare time while watching YouTube. 

Don't worry about importing the dataset into R or other technical issues yet, just focus on something that is interesting to you and might be interesting to others.

We will get back to you before the course starts with more details about what lies ahead of us.

Looking forward meeting you in St Gallen @GSERM!

Michael and Dirk
