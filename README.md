## Data Storytelling with R

This is the home of the Data Storytelling with R course at [GSERM 2025]([https://gserm.org/courses-directory/visualizing-and-communicating-data-with-r/](https://gserm.org/courses-directory)) offered by [Dirk U. Wulff](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/person/93374/2549) & [Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck](https://www.consumer.imu.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/team/prof_dr_schulte_mecklenbeck_michael/index_ger.html).

The creation and communication of data visualizations is a critical step in any data analytic project. Modern open-source software packages offer powerful visualization tools that, when paired with psychological and design principles, can be used to create effective data visualizations. In this course, participants learn to leverage these tools within the programming language R to create carefully designed, publication-ready data visualizations to communicate key insights extracted from data. During and after the course, participants will work on their own data visualization project.
